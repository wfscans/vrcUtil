# vrcUtil

Written for python3.6 will prob work with future versions. Won't work with past version due to f-strings if I recall.

I assume most sane Windows users who might want to use this might not have python installed. So builds are automaticly provided by github cli - https://github.com/wfscans/vrcutil/releases/

Need help? `vrcfav -h!`

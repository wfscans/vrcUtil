# vrcUtil

Written for python3.6 will prob work with future versions. Won't work with past version due to f-strings if I recall.

I assume most sane Windows users who might want to use this might not have python installed. So builds are automaticly provided by github cli - https://github.com/wfscans/vrcutil/releases/

# VRCFAV
A simple CLI script/program that allows you to add/remove worlds from your favorite list from outside the game. If you need help with options try `vrcfav -h`. You do need to run this from a powershell/command prompt(or maybe from a shortcut? Though it wouldn't pause at the end)

# SHAREME
A script that will track your current world and post it to a rentry.co paste that updates as you go. I did it in a way where you could easily add in new ways(twitter is pretty easy). I had it working with 4chan but currently am not releasing that functional. Feel free to do so yourself.
